# Gobang
a Gobang game I made at 2017.02

# How to run
  run ChessServer.js and the module, Socket.io, is needed
  connect to port 'address:8080'
  submit a name , then press 'Play'

  if a bot is needed:
  connect to 'address:8080/indexAI1.html'
  or connect to 'address:8080/indexAI2.html'
  

After alphaGo beat human at Go, my roommate and I start to play Gobang for that it's almost identical to Go. So I made this game to play with my roommate. I also made a bot to compete with the one made by my roommate.

# Gobang
a Gobang game I made at 2017.02  

# How to run
  run ChessServer.js and the module, Socket.io, is needed  
  connect to port 'address:8080'  
  submit a name , press 'Play' and wait for opponent  
  or add a bot  

# if a bot is needed:
  connect to 'address:8080/indexAI1.html'  
  or connect to 'address:8080/indexAI2.html'  
  submit a name , press 'Play' to join a game  
  in a game:  
  press space will lay a chess  
  press 'auto AI' to activate bot  
  
server: node.js + socket.io  
webpage:  
using Jquery to adjust the page display  
using HTML canvas to render the game  

# Why I made this
After alphaGo beat human at Go, my roommate and I start to play Gobang for that it's almost identical to Go. So I made this game to play with my roommate. I also made a bot to compete with the one made by my roommate.
